/*
The Unix `find` command allows you to search for files under a given directory.
You can specify criteria for files you are interested in.

Imagine that you need to implement this functionality in a library/application.
For example, users of the library might want do do the following:

- Find all files with "test" in their name
- Find all files over 5 MB
- Find all XML files
AND

find *.txt /
